# CommandPattern
An example of how to use the Command Pattern

Within this project, you can find a simple implementation of the GoF Command Pattern.
It supports simple commands, with an example using a light, and Macro Commands.

To add more functionality to the solution, simple add your class with implementation
into ItemTypes and create the command classes you want in Commands.

The container method used for Macro Commands can be changed to other containers.

I hope this example can be of use in understanding how the pattern works.
